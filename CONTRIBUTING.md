# Contributing

:smile: Thank you for contributing to Simply!

## Development

Simply uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage front-end packages.

```bash
# clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/godofredoninja/simply.git

# Use branch Dev
$ git checkout dev

# install the dependencies
$ cd simply/src && yarn

# run build & livereload task
$ yarn dev

# link to ghost themes dir
$ ln -s $PWD path/to/ghost/content/themes/simply

# restart ghost server
$ cd path/to/ghost && ghost restart --development
```

### Icons

[Ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons) and generated by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) after import  `src/svg-icons/selection.json`

### Build commands

- `yarn dev` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start [livereload](http://livereload.com/)
- `yarn build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
- `yarn prod` — Compile assets for production and generate a `dist/simply.zip`

### Additional commands

- `yarn lint:js` — [Standard](https://standardjs.com/), Check for errors in the script.
- `yarn lint:sass` — [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), Check for errors in the styles.
- `yarn lint` — Check error in script and styles.
- `yarn scan` — [Ghost Scan](https://github.com/TryGhost/gscan) check for errors, deprecation and other compatibility issues.
- `yarn test` — Check the script errors and styles then check the theme if it is compatible with the latest version of Ghost.

## Git/GitHub workflow

This is our preferred process for opening a PR on GitHub:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch off of `dev` for your work: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
3. Make some changes, committing them along the way
4. When your changes are ready for review, push your branch: `git push origin my-feature-branch`
5. Create a pull request from your branch to `simply/dev`
6. No need to assign the pull request to anyone, we'll review it when we can
7. When the changes have been reviewed and approved, someone will squash and merge for you
